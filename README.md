This project focuses on designing a promotional website for a real-time school, The Ikhlas School, using HTML and CSS. Alongside website development, a detailed report was prepared in MS Word, required calculations were performed using MS Excel, and a presentation was created in PowerPoint to present the project.

For promotion purposes, a video animation of the website was created and shared through a LinkedIn post to showcase the project
